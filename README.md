# FOOD WATCH (POOL 1)

http://food-watch-pool1.iptassociates.com/

IPT Associates, LLC (IPT) used our Agile Vi™ methodology to quickly deliver Food Watch, our OpenFDA Minimum Viable Product (MVP) solution. IPT’s Agile Vi methodology blends the business and technical sides of IPT to form a wholly collaborative Agile enterprise, where iterative processes and continuous feedback loops enable us to quickly deliver customer-focused solutions. Agile Vi allows us to respond rapidly to shifting requirements, make decisions based on the tangible results we deliver, and remove the unnecessary unpredictability associated with traditional software development processes.  

The Food Watch prototype was delivered using the following Agile Vi process which aligns with the U.S. Digital Services Playbook.

## Overall Design Methodology

Food Watch is an example of IPT’s design process compressed into mini-sprints aligned to the original proposal deadline. In a typical design process, these sprints are usually two to three weeks, but for the purpose of this prototype we performed three two-day sprints to show the entirety of our process. All evidence criteria can be found in IPT’s GitHub repository.

During Sprint 1, the customer “Need Statement” that drives the overall development process is garnered. Sprint 2 develops the prototype design, and Sprint 3 iterates on the design. After (and sometimes during) each sprint, user reviews and usability tests occur. The results of these tests and reviews inform the subsequent sprints. 

Prior to Sprint 1, the scrum team came together to clarify each member’s primary role and responsibilities; discuss diverse viewpoints of the team; and decide on the objectives, outcomes solution strategies, and identify known constraints. We identified Mike as the experienced Product Manager (PM) with the authority and responsibility for making decisions and removing obstacles. We assembled a lean scrum team consisting of 1 Product Manager, 2 Developers, 1 Interaction Designer / User Researcher / Usability Tester, and 1 Content Designer/Content Strategist.

## Sprint 1: Envisioning

Sprint 1 focused on meeting with the customer, brainstorming, designing layouts and mock-ups with the customer, preparing our Requirements and Design Document (RDD), and reviewing with the customer for acceptance. 

### Sprint 1 Goal: *Capture the customer’s vision*. Activities included:
* Met with customer to discuss vision and desired outcomes for OpenFDA initiative 
* Defined user personas and developed a customer “Need Statement” as the underpinning for prototype development: Provide consumers with useful information based on the data made available through OpenFDA
* Decided on Food Watch as the solution name, briefly described tool
* Used 5 user-centered techniques or tools: (1) User Interview & Interactive Brainstorm Session, (2) Developed Use Cases, (3) Designed Wireframe, (4) Developed the Food Watch RDD provided in GitHub repository and got user feedback, (5) User survey and crowdsourcing of Food Watch logo design
 
## Sprint 2: Prototype Design 

Sprint 2 takes the knowledge gained from interaction with the customer and develops the requirements into functional software. Based on the RDD, one or more sprints are scheduled within a release window. A typical release usually contains two to four development sprints, with each sprint having at least one customer review session at the end, but IPT’s Agile Vi development process involves the customer as often as possible and as it is appropriate.   

### Sprint 2 Goal: *Develop the use cases and requirements into functional software*. Activities included: 
* The PM identified a MVP based on the Use Cases; the Food Watch food recall exploration tool  
* Used the test scenarios from the use cases to do complete outcome driven testing
* Created a product style guide to establish a consistent style and brand for Food Watch  
* Instantiated the solution technical architecture 
* We chose a modern technology stack and used ten open source technologies (e.g. Durandal, Bootstrap, jQuery, .NET)
* Performed usability tests via interactive whiteboard sessions and review of the RDD
* Feedback sessions provided baseline design from which a design prototype was built

## Sprint 3: Iterative Design and Delivery Preparation

The final Sprint before a release ensures that we have a good agreed to feature set for the customer, and that critical feedback is incorporated into the release. 

### Sprint 3 Goal: *Deliver a working prototype design that satisfies the customer vision*. Activities include:  

* Ensured prototype worked on multiple devices (IE, Google Chrome, iOS, Android) mobile and presented a responsive design 
* Developed and tested to Use Cases identified as key gaps during Sprint 2
* Created Installation Guide 
* Held final internal review to ensure release goals were met 
* Held release post-mortem to ensure lessons learned are captured and used to inform the next release
